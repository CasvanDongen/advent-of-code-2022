# Advent of Code 2022

This repository contains the solutions for the 2022 Advent of Code in Java 17.

## Usage

Open the project in your IDE as a Gradle project, build the module and run the `AdventOfCode` class. By default, the
application will run the challenge from the current day in the calendar. Run a different solution by providing the day
through the `-d` / `--day` argument.
